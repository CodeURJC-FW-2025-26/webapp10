### Fran García
* Description of my tasks during the practice:
  I was responsible for creating the forms on the website. I started with the [CreateGame.html](./CreateGame.html) file, as it was the longest and most complex one. Once I finished it, I moved on to the reviews form in the [Minecraft.html](./Minecraft.html) file. I also made several small improvements and adjustments to other files, and contributed ideas for the website’s design to enhance the overall appearance.
